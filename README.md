Project Overview:

This project is a simple example program that implements the fundamentals of object-oriented programming in Python. 
The code aims to illustrate some basic OOP concepts and techniques, such as creating classes, inheritance, defining methods, and creating objects.


Key Concepts:

- Classes and Objects: Classes are the fundamental building blocks of object-oriented programming. They allow the bundling of data and related operations.
- Inheritance: Inheritance allows a class to inherit the properties and behaviors of another class. It enables code reuse and the creation of hierarchical structures.
- Methods: Methods are functions associated with classes, representing operations or functions related to the class.
